Pong is a table tennisâ€“themed game, featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. It keeps score for both players and changes the background color depending on who is in advance.

If you are playing it on macOS, if you uncomment the import os line and every. os.system() lines, it will play a sound each time the ball touches a paddle or gets out of the screen.
